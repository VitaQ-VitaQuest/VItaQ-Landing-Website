                <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                <p>Welcome to the VitaQ Mobile Application (the "Service"), a premium performance tracking and developmental management platform. This Service is operated by <strong>C-Tech</strong> ("VitaQ," "we," "us," or "our").</p>
                <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and protect information in relation to our mobile services. This policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service ("Users"). Your use of our Service is also governed by our Terms of Service.</p>
                <p>A core function of our Service is to operate as a "white-label" platform for various organizations such as sports academies, training centers, and educational institutions (each, an "Organization" or "Tenant"). Your Organization is the primary controller of the personal data processed through the Service. We act as a data processor on their behalf.</p>
                <p><strong>Understanding Your Data Controller:</strong> It is crucial to understand the division of responsibilities regarding your personal data. Your Organization (e.g., your sports academy) is the <strong>Data Controller</strong> for the personal data you provide through the Service. This means your Organization determines the 'why' and 'how' of processing your data. We, <strong>C-Tech</strong>, act as a <strong>Data Processor</strong> on behalf of your Organization. This means we process the data solely according to your Organization's instructions and for the purposes defined by them in our contractual agreement.</p>
                <p>For example, if you want to know why your performance data is being collected, ask your Organization. If you have any questions about how your data is used, or wish to exercise your privacy rights, your first and primary point of contact must be the administrators of your Organization. We will only respond to such requests if directed by your Organization or required by law.</p>

                <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>We collect the following types of information to provide and improve our Service.</p>
                <h3>A. Information You or Your Organization Provide Directly:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you or your Organization create an account, we collect information such as your name, email address, username, and password (stored in encrypted format).</li>
                    <li><strong>Profile Information:</strong> We collect personal details you provide for your user profile, which may include your full name, phone number, date of birth, and gender.</li>
                    <li><strong>Biometric Data (Optional):</strong> With your explicit written consent (or that of your parent/guardian if you are a minor), which can be obtained through the app's consent interface and revoked at any time through your Organization's administrators, we may process biometric identifiers such as facial geometry data derived from profile pictures for optional facial recognition login. This feature is completely optional and not required for core app functionality, is subject to automatic deletion after 3 years or upon consent withdrawal, is protected by industry-standard encryption, is never shared with third parties except as required by law, and is subject to additional protections for Illinois residents under BIPA. Where facial recognition involves AI systems, we ensure compliance with regulations like the EU AI Act through risk assessments and transparency measures as instructed by your Organization.</li>
                    <li><strong>Trainee and Guardian Information:</strong> For users who are trainees, especially minors, we collect information provided by a parent, legal guardian, or the Organization. This includes the trainee's name, date of birth, and performance data. We also collect information about the relationship between guardians and trainees ("Connections").</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance and Activity Data:</strong> We collect all data related to trainee development, including performance evaluations, exercise results, goals, rankings, and any notes or feedback entered by administrators and coaches.</li>
                    <li><strong>User Content:</strong> We collect content you may provide through the app, such as profile pictures or videos, for which we require access to your device's Camera and Photo Library.</li>
                    <li><strong>Communications:</strong> We may keep a record of any communications between you and us (e.g., support emails) for up to 2 years for quality assurance and legal compliance.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>B. Information Collected Through App Permissions:</h3>
                <p>To provide full functionality, the app may request access to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Contacts:</strong> To allow you to easily invite and connect with members and guardians within your Organization by selecting specific contacts. We do not store or access your entire address book; access is limited to the contacts you explicitly choose to share. You can revoke this permission at any time through your device settings, though this may limit invitation features.</li>
                    <li><strong>Camera and Photo Library:</strong> To allow you to take and upload profile pictures or training-related media. We access only the specific photos or videos you select to upload. You can revoke this permission at any time through your device settings, though this may limit media upload features.</li>
                    <li><strong>Calendar:</strong> To schedule and manage evaluation appointments directly on your device's calendar. We access only the calendar events you choose to create or modify through the app. You can revoke this permission at any time through your device settings, though this may prevent automatic scheduling features.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>C. Information We Collect Automatically:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We use third-party analytics services, specifically PostHog, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. This data is typically aggregated and anonymized. You can learn more about PostHog's practices at https://posthog.com/privacy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We may collect information about the device you use to access our Service, including the hardware model, operating system and version, app version, and pseudonymized device identifiers. Unique device identifiers are hashed or pseudonymized where possible to prevent direct identification and are used only for Service improvement and security purposes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Log Data:</strong> Our servers automatically record information ("Log Data") created by your use of the Service, including IP address (which we may pseudonymize), browser type, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.</li>
                </ul>
